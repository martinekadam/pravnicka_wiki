<Quiz question="What was the legal effect of 'Capitis Diminutio Media'?">

  <QuizOption label="Loss of citizenship only." isCorrect={false}>
    It's more severe than that. According to the *Institutes of Gaius*:
    
    > "Middle loss of status occurs when citizenship is lost but liberty is retained."
    
    **Key consequences:**
    * Loss of *ius suffragii* (voting)
    * Loss of *ius honorum* (holding office)

  <QuizOption label="Loss of citizenship and family rights." isCorrect={true}>
    Exactly. As per the textbook (Para. 42):
    
    This involved a change in **civitas**. When a person loses their citizenship, they inevitably lose their position in the Roman family structure because the *patria potestas* is a right exclusive to Roman citizens.
    
    1. The person becomes a *peregrinus*.
    2. All existing agnatic ties are severed.
